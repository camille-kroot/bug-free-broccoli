# git lets you take snapshots of what you are doing. Capture the moment
# there are two steps: staging and committing
# staging: click staged and take a photo of this one document (can stage multiple things at once)
# then hit commit-- after committing, the file disappears because there is nothing new to snapshot. If you change the code, then save, then you can take a new snapshot
# this acts as a "master undo" button! Nice history with different versions!
# You can see everything under history (Git --> History)
